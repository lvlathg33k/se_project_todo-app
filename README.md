# Simple Todo App

Refactoring this todo app is where I learn object oriented programming principles.

## Functionality

The Simple Todo App allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks that are no longer needed. The app provides a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technology

This project layers previous lessons with the latest. The focus was to learn OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Understanding these concepts allows me to leverage object classes and "this."

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
